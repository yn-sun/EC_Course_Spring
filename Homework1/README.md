# Homework1_EC_2022S
The first course assignment of Evolutionary Computing 01 in Spring 2022

#****Requirements：
# Designing a genetic algorithm to solve the first problem, and following the instructions:
## 1. clearly pointintg out the following steps in the implementations:
- initialization
- fitness evaluation
- selection for crossover and mutation
- environmental selection

## 2. please set the following components based on your own preferences:
- the probabilities of crossover, mutation, elitsm
- the size of population, the types of crossover and mutation
- and etc.

## 3. please independently run the algorithms at least 30 times, and finally report the mean and std values

## 4. please draw the evolutionary process using the data from any run
 - collecting the data (the generation number as well as its corresponding fitness value) during some run, say the fifth run;
 - plot the data in a two-dimension axis;
 - the horizontal axis denotes the generation number, and the vertical axis denotes the fitness value.
 - try to conclude something from this figure plotted.
 
## 5. please draw the mean, max, and min values of the same generation in different runs (boxplot?)
 - collecting the fitness values of the same generations in all runs;
 - using boxplot to plot the data collected from the 30 runs;
 - try to conclude something from this figure plotted.
